    <h1>Elite upbringing</h1>
    <h4>{ Family support system }</h4>
    <p>
      Dear parents,
      I provide re~established method from past in thoughtful, emotionally aware children care, moving away from 'babysitting' to elite upbringing.
      My aim is to be a calm, creative presence who helps family develop clarity, imagination, and strength.
    </p>

  <div class="part-b">
    <p>
      I speak English and Serbian fluently, have experience in creative and healthy living disciplines, practical work and carry myself with quiet elegance and emotional intelligence.
      I imagine working best with families who value gentleness, poise, and a touch of old-world mentoring in a modern setting.

      Fine blend between tutor, caregiver and protector.

      “Preparing the child gently but honestly for a complex world—with grace, poise, and complexity.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn’t simple daycare or just play—it’s mentorship and real assistance. The goal is not to replace parents, it's to support them.
      This setup works best for expats, diplomats, creatives, or dual-career couples, having someone they fully trust to protect the child and family interest.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Calm and clear authority, like a finishing school meets child-ally</li>
      <li> Helping children process complex identity cues / rising social complexities </li>
      <li> Soft intelligence—cognitive, emotional, and narrative-based care</li>
    </ul>

   <p>
      <small> <em>(smoke-free, ideologies-free, profanity-free, soft balanced appearance, available for traveling with family if needed...)</em></small>

    <p>
      Yes it is rare. In fact, it’s elite-class old-school value wrapped in modern emotional intelligence.
        If this resonates with your family’s needs, I’d be honored to connect and talk further.
        <br />
        <br />
        With grace,
        <br />
        Pera...
